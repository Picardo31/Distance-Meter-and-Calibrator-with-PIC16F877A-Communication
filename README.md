The use of USAR communication allows complex operating parameters to be established between two or more microcontrollers to carry out an action, in this case, measure distance, and calibrate the maximum and minimum distance, which consequently allows dividing software tasks into microcontrollers with which to work, whose advantage is to reduce computational time to process them.
